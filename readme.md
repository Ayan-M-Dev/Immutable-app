# Immutable Passport
Immutable Passport is a simple and secure onboarding solution designed for games and developers which aims to enable an enhanced user-friendly experience for gamers through offering passwordless sign-on and automated wallet creation.

# Overview
Immutable Passport being non-custodial, never takes custody of private keys! Users have full ownership and control over their private keys where only the user can access and manage the funds on their Immutable Passport.

Beyond just wallet functionalities, the Immutable Passport also integrates vertically across the Immutable platform offering developers access to gamers, marketplaces and an infrastructure that scales to meet the needs of games.

Essentially, with Immutable Passport, gamers will only create their Passport once and Immutable Passport will grant them access to all games and marketplaces built on Immutable, eliminating the need for gamers to create a new account for every game!

# Enter the following command in your terminal.

```

It is also important that we install the @imtbl/sdk that enables all the passport functions. Enter the following command in your terminal.

```
npm install @imtbl/sdk@0.28.0
```

```
npm run dev
```
